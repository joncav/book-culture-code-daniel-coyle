# Section: Build Safety

## Chapter 1 - The Good Apples
- Lean in and get personal, listen and be enthusiastic, it’s more contagious than negativity
  - Close physical proximity, often in circles
  - Profuse amounts of eye contact
  - Physical touch
  - Lots of short energetic exchanges (no long speeches)
  - High levels of mixing, everyone talks to everyone
  - Few interruptions
  - Lots of questions
  - Intensive, active listening
  - Humor, laughter
  - Small, attentive courtesies, thank-yous, opening doors
- Team performance is driven by 5 measurable factors:
- Everyone talks/listens equally
- Members maintain high levels of eye contact
- Members communicate with one another, not just with leader
- Members carry on back-channel or side conversations
- Members periodically break, go exploring outside the team and bring info back to share with others

## Chapter 2 - The Billion-Dollar Day when nothing happened
- Google made a practice of close proximity conversations
- Friday open forum discussion, about problem-solving
- Hockey games with each other
- Created culture with "belonging queues"
- Belonging queue, solving a puzzle and get a personal note. This makes you tuned in twice as much because you feel someone is looking out for you.
- The cell phone experiment, saying "I'm sorry it's raining" before asking for the phone increase receptivity 422%
- Dr. Gregory Walton, Suicide patients who received a postcard from the hospital were readmitted at 1/2 the rate.
- Small signals can have huge waves
- Outcomes: The moment you're part of a group your amygdala lights up, you begin tracking those people because they are valuable to you. By providing moments that fuel the flame, safe connection which creates cohesion.

## Chapter 3 - The Christmas Truce, the One-Hour Experiment and the Missileers
- The Christmas Truce: Conversations can happen in little ways, almost rebel like
- Little signals, instilling more trust, I'll go halfway if you will
- WIPRO Experiment (two test groups, in addition to regular)
  - Was loosing 50% - 70% of employees each year
  - Test group 1, same training as regular and an additional hour focused on WIPRO's identity. Heard about companies successes, met a "star performer" and answered questions about their first impressions.
  - Test group 2, same training as regular, and additional hour not focused on the company but on the employee. These trainees were asked questions like "What is unique about you, that leads to your happiest times and best performance as work?
  - Test group 2 cont, In a brief exercise they were asked to imagine they were lost at sea and to consider what special skills the might bring into the situation. At the end of the hour, they were given a fleece sweatshirt embroidered with their name alongside the companies name.
- WIPRO cont: 7 months later after the experiment. Group 1 was 157% more likely than the original group, and group 2 was 250% more likely.
  - They attribute this to belonging queues

## Chapter 4, How to build belonging
- Hug them and love them - your role after a loss. Tell you the truth with no BS, and hug you.
- Holding people to a high standard because they can achieve it
- Relentless performance feedback that translates to “We have high standards here”
- Used a mixed cue that affirms and strengthens the fabric of relationships
- Big picture perspective - family, food, hobbies, history, politics - life is bigger than work
- After a big super important loss the Spurs coach, acted like things were normal - over dinner with players and family

## Chapter 5, How to design for belonging
- Unconsciously connecting people and letting them figure out what’s next.
- The distance of separation, the distance of fewer than 8 meters communication rise off the charts.
- The mathematical structure of “Collisions” which Tony Heish tries to have 1000 per year (opportunities to connect).
- The WIPRO study, personal intro to company success, personal inquiry about their strengths/embroidered sweater = HIGH retention

## Chapter 6, Ideas for action
- Try to show your listening, looking in their eyes, ask questions or their opinions.
- Over-communicate your listening (body language, affirmations)
- The smoothness of turn-taking is a powerful sign of cohesion, interrupts shatter smooth interactions (exception of creative ideation)
- Spotlight your fallibility early on, especially if you're a leader
- Embrace the messenger of bad news, let them know how important to you that feedback was.
- Preview future connections, like telling a story about the outcomes someone else achieved in their same path
- Overdo Thank Yous, they are crucial belonging queues, especially on unseen positions
- Be painstaking in the hiring process
- Eliminate bad apples “no dickheads” rule from all blacks
- Create safe collision rich spaces, more coffee options and places to mingle
- Consider in-house food creating, keep quality high and connections plentiful
- Make sure everyone has a voice
- Ask what they would change/do/not do if it were them (pg 86)
- Sweep the shed - make it everyone’s job to pitch in and clean up
- Capitalize on threshold moments: Big intros, speak life to them like “We need you to make monitoring IT better.”
- Avoid giving Sandwich feedback, allow there to be good feedback (soak), criticism (soak)
- Embrace fun - laughter is not just laughter it’s the most fundamental sign of safety and connection

# Section: Share Vulnerability

## Chapter 7 - Tell me what you want and I’ll help
- Small interactions
- The humblest primitive form of communication
- Fluid trusting cooperation, sometimes not some pretty
- Struggle together and figure out what’s going on
- Brain trusts, for candid feedback on performance
- After Action Reviews, where the team as equals discuss mission/outcomes
- Start toward success: If you ask for help 10 times we’ll know you succeeded if you don’t then it will be an utter disaster

## Chapter 8 -  The Vulnerability Loop
- Sending a signal that you’re vulnerable allows others to take down their guard too, the norm is established and closeness and trust increase
- The statement like “Anybody have any ideas?”, this can open up possibilities for others to step up and put themselves in a position best for the situation
- Trust comes down to context, and what drives it is the sense that you’re vulnerable, that you need others and can’t do it on your own
- The balloon test, by signaling vulnerability they joined up with everyone in the hunt, cooperation
- Exchanges of vulnerability are the pathway to which trusting cooperation is built
  - Cooperation doesn’t happen out of the blue, it’s a group muscle built according to a specific pattern of repeated interactions. A circle of people engaged in the risky occasionally painful, ultimately rewarding process of being vulnerable together
  - The vulnerability loop can create a connection from a seemingly desperate groups

## Chapter 9 - The Super Cooperators
- Vulnerability and interconnectedness during times of extreme pressure where the minute actions/mistakes of each member can be felt, and they can feel yours. In this time you have to make a choice. Do I focus on me, or the team?
- Example
- cont. A teammate falters, Other teammates feel it, taking more pain on themselves to make an adjustment for the team, balance is regained
- Everything is done as a group, keeping track of each other is required
- We’re looking for the micro event. Every evolution is an opportunity to look for teamwork moments. Through multiple events stitched together you start to know who the good teammates will be.
- Closeness and corporation, it’s more than guest teamwork
- Del Close Harold rules
- cont. Every rule directs you to either tamp down selfish instincts that might make you the center of attention or to serve your fellow actors (support, save, trust, listen).

## Chapter 10 - How to create cooperation in small groups
- Having one person tell other people what to do won't work
- Create a system in which teams think in a hive mentality
- Create conditions where they will start to do it
- AAR, the backbone of humility
- Talk about every decision
- Resist the temptation to “wrap it up”
- Keep digging to find out what happened
- Eventually, everyone begins to see what happened, not just their small piece
- Relentless willingness to see the truth and take ownership
- Ask: What’s going on here

## Chapter 11 - How to create cooperation with individuals
- Bell labs, most accomplished: ate together with quiet Swedish man Harry Nyquist. The point being he challenged their thinking on projects sparking creativity
- Harry made people feel cared for, fatherly. Second was relentless curiosity
- Givechi @IDEO Flights: meetings at start, middle and end of every project
- Flights cont: Learn issues the team has been wrestling with, design/dev
- “Surfacing” - With landscape set ask questions to unearth tensions, and help gain clarity about themselves and the projects
- Modules Givechi developed:
  - The one thing that excites me about this particular opportunity is:
  - I confess, the one thing I’m not particularly excited about with this opportunity is:
  - On this project I would really like to get better at:
- These modules do nothing without the most important, listening deeply
- Understanding of what makes people tick, and sometimes those things are not so nice (I.e. having a conversation that questions someone, because that drives them forward)
- The most important moments in a conversation happen when someone is actively, intently listening, to connect completely with this person

## Chapter 12 - Ideas for action
- Make sure the leader is vulnerable first and often
- Make it: safe to tell the truth here
- Over-communicate expectations: The successful groups made sure the need for collab was communicated - largely. The little book of IDEO.
- “Collaborate and make other successful: Going out of your way to help others be successful is the secret sauce.”
- Deliver the negative stuff in person: rejected budget for example. Negative news or feedback should be face to face it’s far more comfortable to deliver this news electronically, resist it
- Team rules: when a player violates have them reconnect (with their manager, and pay a price to do so. Possibly around reconnecting to the mission or principles)
- When forming two groups focus on two critical moments (pg 162):
-	The first vulnerability
-	The first disagreement
-	In these times people either get defensive and start justifying or are willing to explore learning together
- Whenever you ask a question usually the first response is not the answer it’s the first response. Find ways to slowly surface the things that need to be shared so people can build from it. Then you build questions from that response so you can build more
- In Conversation you have to resist the temptation to reflexively add value.
- Skilled listeners do not interrupt with phrases like: Hey here’s an idea
- Simple way to get more by saying: “Say more about that”
- Create a scaffold of thoughtfulness
- Use Candor building practices like AAR’s, BrainTrusts, Red Teaming.
- AAR
  - What were our intended results?
  - What were our actual results?
  - What caused our results?
  - What will we do the same next time?
  - What will we do differently?
- Before Action Review
  - Intended results
  - Challenges we can anticipate
  - What have we or others learned from similar situations?
  - What will make us successful this time?
- RE AAR, BrainTrust: Build the habit of opening up to vulnerability
- Aim for Candor avoid Brutal Honestly
- Embrace the discomfort: pain is not the problem, it’s the path to building a better team
- Align language with action: I.e. “design community leaders” or “Plus” comments about work which says “Adding value” vs correcting
- Build a wall between Performance Review and Professional Development
  - Performance evaluation: High-risk, feedback which could negative
  - Professional development: Identifying strengths, and what you can do to help
  - Consider a coaching model with frequent feedback
- Use flash mentoring: A few hours from someone who you admire or what to learn from
- Make the leader occasionally disappear: Sometimes the team needs to figure it out themselves, All Blacks - practices on their own, Seal team - sometimes for training they do it themselves and they know best

Section: Establish Purpose

## Chapter 13 - Three hundred and eleven words
- Johnson & Johnson Credo: asked to be reviewed to be changed. It wasn’t having an impact on new young hires
- Focus: What’s all this for? What are we working towards?
- KIPP: Signs, and rhythm, “where are you going to college”, “work hard be nice”
- Seals: Shoot move and communicate
- Starlings: Move in one direction together, small signals which they sense from those around them which they keep a close watch on. Relentless attention to a small set of details
- Create simple beacons that focus attention and engagement on the shared goal
- Small vivid signals: Here’s where we are, here’s where we want to go
- Mental contrasting: Envision an achievable goal and envision the obstacles
  - Can raise the participation to prepare or make decisions along the way to your goal
- Stories are not just stories, they are the best invention ever for creating mental models that drive behavior
- Speak big about the story, share large the goal and expected outcome which can boost the participation of others who can influence the story
- Teachers told students would successes (although there was no proof) behaved as allies to their success and the outcome was significant
- Attributed to:
  - Warmth
  - Input
  - Response opportunity
  - Feedback

## Chapter 14 - The hooligans and Surgeons
- Show: We are here to get along by being tolerant of what they are about
- Successful initiatives/learning:
  - Framing: conceptualize how this benefits, not just adds on
  - Roles: told individuals why their role mattered in the mission/team
  - Rehearsal: Did elaborate dry runs, preparing in detail - communicating
  - Explicit encouragement: Successful teams were told by leadership to speak up if they saw a problem, and they were actively coached through the feedback process
  - Active reflection: Between surgeries, successful teams went over performance, discussed future cases and suggested improvements
- Steady pulse of real-time signals that channeled attention toward the larger goal. To flood the environment between what they were doing now and what it meant.
- They all knew about everything, work as a team
- Small, attentive, consistent - where they are now, where they are headed
- Everyday movements: when people can sense the message

Chapter 15 - How to lead for proficiency
- The number one job is to take care of each other
- Find a way to deliver the signal
- Rank the priorities
- Name the specific behaviors and reactions
- What is the core purpose?
- Many leaders of high proficiency groups focus on:
  - creating priorities
  - naming keystone behaviors
  - flooding the environment with heuristics
  - Examples: page 213

## Chapter 16 - How to lead for creativity
- Hire people smarter than you
- Fail early, fail often
- Listen to everyone’s ideas
- Face toward the problems
- B-level work is bad for your soul
- It’s more important to invest in good people than in good ideas

## Chapter 17 - Ideas for action
- Name and rank your priorities
- Be ten times as clear about your priorities as you think you should be
- Figure out where your group aims for proficiency and where it aims for creativity
- For proficiency groups (service):
  - Fill the groups windshields with clear accessible models of excellence
  - Provide high-repetition high-feedback training
  - Build vivid memorial every rules of thumb
  - Spotlight and honor the fundamentals of the skill
- For creative groups (builders)
  - Support, fuel, tools
  - Keenly attend to team composition and dynamics
  - Define, reinforce, and relentlessly protect the teams creative autonomy
  - Make it safe to fail and give feedback
  - Celebrate hugely when the group takes initiative
- Embrace the use of catch-phrases, p231
-  Measure what really matters (success vs numbers)
- Focus on bar setting behaviors - Forty for Forty, the idea that establishing a bar setting behavior even though rigorous can/will make the difference
